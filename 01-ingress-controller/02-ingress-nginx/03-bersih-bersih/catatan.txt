I find a ture answaer, i belive.
delete all the svc. pods deployment , secret ,rs, cs, use yaml file when you apply except kube-system namespace
like the under.
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.0.4/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
and apply the new
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.0.4/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
and everthing looks like good .
